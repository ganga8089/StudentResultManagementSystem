# StudentResultManagementSystem
The Student Result Management System is a Java-based desktop application developed using the 
 MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and Swing for the graphical user interface. It provides an 
 efficient and user-friendly platform for managing and viewing student academic results. The system 
 allows teachers to securely log in using predefined credentials, add new student records along with 
 their class and subject-wise marks, and view all student data in a tabular format. Each newly added 
 student is automatically assigned a unique ID and login credentials, enabling students to log in  
separately to view their own results, including total marks, percentage, and pass/fail status. The 
 backend is powered by MySQL, ensuring reliable data storage and retrieval. The model handles all 
 database operations, the controller acts as a bridge between the model and the view, and the view 
 layer provides an intuitive, modern, and professional interface. This modular and structured design 
 enhances maintainability, usability, and scalability, making the system an effective tool for  
educational institutions to simplify result management and improve transparency between teachers 
 and students.
